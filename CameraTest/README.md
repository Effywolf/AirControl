# AirControl

Control your music with hand gestures.

## About

AirControl allows you to control music playback using hand gestures captured through your camera.

## Features

## How It Works

The app uses your device camera to detect hand gestures in real time. These gestures are translated into music control commands, allowing you to control playback without touching your device.

* Pinch = mute/unmute
* Thumbs up = volume up
* Thumbs down = volume down
* Swipe left = next track
* Swipe right = previous track

## Requirements

* Camera access

## WIP

* Callibration is buggy
